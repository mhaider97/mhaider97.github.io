# 👋 Hii, I’m Haider  

I’m a backend engineer who loves building things end-to-end.  
Mostly working with **Python, Java, and AWS**, but I also dabble in **React** when I need some frontend spice 🌶️.  

When I’m not coding, you’ll probably find me:  
- 💪 Lifting at the gym  
- ✈️ Traveling to new places  
- 📺 Watching anime & movies  
- 🎤 Singing (I promise my code hits fewer bugs than my high notes 😅)

This blog is where I share my projects, notes, and experiments as I learn in public. 🚀
